HEALTH PROFESSIONALS REPORT: A (B)(6) MALE PATIENT WITH MEDICAL HISTORY OF STROKE, APPENDECTOMY AT THE AGE OF (B)(6) AND ABLATION OF ONE MICRO POLYP DURING COLONOSCOPY IN (B)(6) 2014, BUT WITHOUT HISTORY OF GASTROINTESTINAL DISEASE, UNDERWENT A CT VIRTUAL COLONOSCOPY WITH PROTOCO21 FOR COLON INSUFFLATION SET FOLEY CATHETER (REF. 6450, LOT NUMBER UNK) ON (B)(6) 2014 DUE TO INCOMPLETE VISUALIZATION OF THE RIGHT ANGLE OF COLON DURING THE COLONOSCOPY IN (B)(6) 2014.

DURING THE PROCEDURE THE BALLOON EXPLODED WHILE THE PATIENT CHANGED FROM DORSAL TO LATERAL POSITION. THE PATIENT HAD NOTICED A CHANGE AND THE IMAGING TEAM REALIZED THAT THE BALLOON HAD EXPLODED. THE PROCEDURE WAS STOPPED, BUT COULD BE RESTARTED AND FINALIZED WITHOUT PROBLEM ON THE SAME DAY WITH ANOTHER BALLOON ADMINISTRATION SET FOLEY CATHETER. NO MEDICAL CONSEQUENCES AT ALL OCCURRED FOR THE PATIENT. OUTCOME: UNK. THIS CASE IS MEDICALLY CLOSED.

THE PATIENT HAD NO HISTORY OF GASTROINTESTINAL DISEASE. HOWEVER, DURING THE COLONOSCOPY PERFORMED 3 MONTHS AGO, ONE MICRO POLYP WAS REMOVED. OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY INCLUDED APPENDECTOMY AT THE AGE OF (B)(6) AND STROKE. DURING THE PROCEDURE, WHILE CHANGING POSITION, THE PATIENT NOTICED A CHANGE, AND SUBSEQUENTLY THE IMAGING TEAM NOTED THAT THE BALLOON HAD EXPLODED. THERE WAS NO CLINICAL CONSEQUENCE FOR THE PATIENT DUE TO THE EVENT AND THE PROCEDURE COULD BE COMPLETED WITH ANOTHER BALLOON ON THE SAME DAY. TO PERFORM CT COLONOSCOPY THIN CATHETER WITH SMALL BALLOON IS GENERALLY USED. EXPLOSION OF THE BALLOON MIGHT OCCUR AND THIS COULD BE THE RESULT OF A BALLOON OVER-DISTENTION OR OF A VARIATION OF THE RESULTANT FORCE BETWEEN THE EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL PRESSURE OF THE BALLOON. IN THIS CASE, THE BALLOON INFLATION HAD BEEN TESTED BEFORE ITS INSERTION INTO THE RECTUM. THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF AIR USED TO INFLATE THE BALLOON WAS 50 ML (35 ML PLUS 15 ML). THE INCIDENT HAS BEEN CONSIDERED POSSIBLY RELATED TO THE PROCEDURE SINCE THE BALLOON EXPLOSION OCCURRED WHEN THE PATIENT CHANGE POSITION (E.G. FROM DORSAL DECUBITUS TO LATERAL DECUBITUS). IN FACT, DURING THE CT COLONOSCOPY, WHEN THE PATIENT CHANGE THE POSITION FROM SUPINE TO PRONE A HIGHER PRESSURE UP TO 40-50 MMHG COULD BE GENERATED INTO THE COLON INSTEAD OF THE OPTIMAL ONE OF 25 MMHG. IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE, A VARIATION OF THE RESULTANT FORCE BETWEEN THE EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL PRESSURE OF THE BALLOON COULD OCCUR AND DETERMINE AND EXPLOSION/DEFLATION OF THE BALLOON. BASED ON THE ABOVE, EVEN THOUGH THE EVENT IS CONSIDERED NOT MANUFACTURING RELATED BUT PROCEDURAL RELATED, THE MANUFACTURER HAS DECIDED TO HAVE A CONSERVATIVE APPROACH AND TO REPORT THIS CASE.",

SPECIFICALLY: ORIGINAL SENTENCE OF: \"THERE IS MINIMAL AORTIC STENOSIS PRESENT\" HAS BEEN CHANGED TO: \"THERE IS AORTIC VALVE SCLEROSIS WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT AORTIC VALVE STENOSIS\". IN THIS ISSUE, THE ORIGINAL SENTENCE INDICATES THE PRESENCE OF MINIMAL AORTIC STENOSIS.

THIS CHANGE WOULD NOT REFLECT THE INTENT OF THE ORIGINAL READING CARDIOLOGIST AND WOULD BE INACCURATE. POTENTIAL IMPACT: IF THE CHANGE WAS MADE AFTER REPORTS HAD BEEN GENERATED WITH THE ORIGINAL SENTENCE SELECTED, THOSE REPORTS PRIOR TO THE CHANGE COULD DISPLAY INCORRECT CLINICAL DATA IF VIEWED IN RM OF IF USED AS A TEMPLATE FOR A REPEAT STUDY ON THAT PT. THERE HAS BEEN NO REPORTED PT HARM FOR THIS OCCURRENCE. A REPORTABLE CORRECTION IS UNDERWAY FOR THIS ISSUE AND HAS BEEN REPORTED TO THE FDA VIA REFERENCE #Z-2112-10.

THE TARGET LESION IS A DE NOVO NATIVE MID LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING CORONARY ARTERY (VESSEL DIAMETER 3.5 MM X LESION LENGTH 15 MM). THE LESION IS CHARACTERIZED AS: CLASS B1, NON-OSTIAL, SMOOTH CONTOUR, READILY ACCESSIBLE IN THE PROXIMAL SEGMENT, NO ANGULATION, CONCENTRIC WITH LITTLE TO NO CALCIFICATION, AND NO THROMBUS WAS PRESENT. THE LESION WAS NOT PRE-DILATED AND DIRECT STENTING WAS DONE WITH A CYPHER STENT, 18 MM X 3.5 MM WITH A MAX INFLATIO PRESSURE OF 12 ATM WITH SATISFYING RESULTS. THE PRE AND POST-MLD MEASUREMENTS WERE NOT DONE. VISUALLY ESTIMATED, THE PRE-PROCEDURE DIAMETER STENOSIS WAS 50% AND THE POST-PROCEDURE RESIDUAL DIAMETER STENOSIS WAS 0%. TIMI FLOW PRE AND POST-PROCEDURE WAS III. DURING THE INTRAL PROCEDURE THE PT HAD CEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE. EVENT EVALUATION: THE EVENT WAS UNLIKELY RELATED TO THE DEVICE AND THE PROCEDURE. THE EVENT WAS SEVERE AND SERIOUS REQUIRING 90 DAYS PROLOGATION OF THE EXISTING HOSPITALIZATION AND RESULTED IN A PERMANENT DISABILITY.

SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY WAS PERFORMED AND IDENTIFIED THE AREA ON BOTH QUADFILAR COILS AS BEING MECHANICALLY DAMAGED WHICH PREVENTED IDENTIFICATION OF THE COIL FRACTURE TYPE WITH PITTING ON THE MARKED QUADFILAR COIL BREAK AREA. IT IS BELIEVED THAT STIMULATION WAS PRESENT FOR A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME AS EVIDENCED BY THE PRESENCE OF METAL PITTING. LOW MAGNIFICATION SEM ANALYSIS OF THE QUADFILAR COIL SHOWS CHARACTERISTICS TYPICAL OF A LEAD DISCONTINUITY WHICH MAY INCLUDE: MATERIAL FRACTURE, ROUGH OR PITTED SURFACE, THINNED MATERIAL THICKNESS, ELECTRO-ETCHING OR MATERIAL DISSOLUTION. THE ABRADED OPENINGS FOUND ON THE OUTER SILICONE TUBING, MOST LIKELY PROVIDED THE LEAKAGE PATH FOR WHAT APPEARED TO BE REMNANTS OF DRIED BODY FLUIDS / TISSUE AND WHITE DEPOSITS FOUND INSIDE THE OUTER SILICONE TUBING. FOR THE OBSERVED INNER TUBING FLUID REMNANTS, THERE WAS NO OBVIOUS PATH FOR FLUID INGRESS OTHER THAN THE CUT ENDS THAT WERE MADE DURING THE EXPLANTED PROCESS. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE OBSERVED DISCONTINUITIES, THE CONDITION OF THE RETURNED LEAD PORTIONS IS CONSISTENT WITH CONDITIONS THAT TYPICALLY EXIST FOLLOWING AN EXPLANT PROCEDURE. NO OTHER OBVIOUS ANOMALIES WERE NOTED. THE SETSCREW MARKS FOUND ON THE UNMARKED CONNECTOR PIN PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT, AT ONE POINT IN TIME, A GOOD MECHANICAL AND ELECTRICAL CONNECTION WAS PRESENT. CONTINUITY CHECKS OF THE RETURNED LEAD PORTIONS WERE PERFORMED, DURING THE VISUAL ANALYSIS, AND NO OTHER DISCONTINUITIES WERE IDENTIFIED. NOTE THAT SINCE THE MARKED CONNECTOR BOOT, AND A LARGE PORTION OF THE LEAD ASSEMBLY (BODY) INCLUDING THE ELECTRODES WAS NOT RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS, AN EVALUATION AND RESULTING COMMENTARY CANNOT BE MADE ON THAT PORTION OF THE LEAD.",

THIS METHOD OF SIZING BASED UPON WHITE-TO-WHITE AND ANTERIOR CHAMBER DEPTH MEASUREMENTS WAS USED IN THE FDA CLINICAL TRIAL AND IS RECOMMENDED IN THE CURRENT LABELING OF THE ICL.
