# fake-api

Servers static json files to url requests. Using the Request URL as a key to know what file to server back. NOTE: This 
was designed just to server static files.

If you want to add more json files to the server then dump the file in ./payload/json directory then update results.json
file to reflect that change. Might have to restart the server when this is done.


## To Run

```node www/bin```
